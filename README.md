- ⚡ Fun fact: I once navigated the creative world as a landscape designer,
              sculpting outdoor spaces with an artist's touch. Fast forward to today,
              and you'll find me immersed in the dynamic realm of computer science.
              I've traded the palette and plants for algorithms and code,
              expressing my passion for artificial intelligence and machine learning.
